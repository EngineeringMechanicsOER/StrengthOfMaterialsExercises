# Problem 5.34 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A copper circular rod of radius r = 4 cm is inserted into an aluminum tube with inner radius r<sub>i</sub> = 5 cm and outer radius r<sub>o</sub> = 6 cm as shown. Load P is applied to the rigid top plate. If length L = 15 cm, what load P will cause the plate to deflect dL = 0.23 mm downward? Assume E<sub>copper</sub> = 110 GPa and E<sub>aluminum</sub> = 70 GPa.
