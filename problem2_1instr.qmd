## Solution - Problem 2.1

![](images/138.png)

Reactions at the wall need to be found:

$$\Sigma F = 0 = R-F_1+F_2+F_3$$

Solving for R:

$$R = F_1-F_2-F_3$$

The force in each bar must be found:

$$F_{AB} = R\\$$ $$F_{BC} = F_1\\$$ $$F_{CD} = F_1-F_2\\$$ Bar radii need to be calculated:

$$r = d/2\\$$ $$r_{AB} = (8 mm/2) = 4 mm = 0.004 m\\$$ 
$$r_{BC} = (6mm/2) = 3mm = 0.003m\\$$
$$r_{CD} = (10mm/2) = 5mm = 0.005 m\\$$

Then stress can be calculated for each bar:

$$\sigma = F/[\pi*r^2]\\$$ $$\sigma_{AB} = F_{AB}/[\pi*0.004^2]\\$$ $$\sigma_{BC} = F_{BC}/[\pi*0.003^2]\\$$ $$\sigma_{CD} = F_{CD}/[\pi*0.005^2]\\$$

The maximum absolute stress is the variable of interest:

$$solution = max(|\sigma_{AB}|,|\sigma_{BC}|,|\sigma_{CD}|)$$
