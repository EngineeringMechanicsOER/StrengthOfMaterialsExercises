# Problem 8.2 - Centroid {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

For the beam cross-section shown, determine the centroid location, measured from the top surface. Assume dimensions a = 3 in. and b = 3 in.

![Figure 1: A cross section has filets and a tapered base.](images/676.png){fig-alt="A cross section has a maximum width of 1.5+a and a maximum height of 1.75+b. The cross section has filets in the top two corners of radius 0.75 in. The cross section has two triangles on the bottom of height b and width 1.25 in."}
