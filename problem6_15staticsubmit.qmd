# Problem 6.15 - Torsional Deformation {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A hollow circular rod is attached to a wall and subjected to a torque T = 3 kN-m at the free end.The rod has inner diameter 8 cm and outer diameter 10 cm.  Determine the angle of twist at x = 300 mm. Assume G = 100 GPa and L = 500 mm.
