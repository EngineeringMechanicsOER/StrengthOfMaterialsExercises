# Problem 12.13 - Principal Stresses {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The state of stress at a point in a beam is shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 25 ksi, σ<sub>y</sub> = 15 ksi, and τ<sub>xy</sub> is unknown. The maximum shear stress for this state of stress is τ<sub>max</sub> = 30 ksi. Determine the angle that this maximum stress occurs at.
