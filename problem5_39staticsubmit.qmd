# Problem 5.39 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A concrete post of length L = 0.3  m and diameter d<sub>c</sub> = 120 mm supports a load F = 150 kN. The concrete is reinforced with 6 steel rods of diameter d<sub>s</sub> = 10 mm. Assume E<sub>concrete</sub> = 25 GPa and E<sub>steel</sub> = 200 GPa. Determine the stress in the concrete.
