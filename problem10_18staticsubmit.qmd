# Problem 10.18 - Shear Flow {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A 4-m-long beam is constructed by nailing together two wooden boards as shown. The nails each have a diameter d = 5 mm and can withstand an average shear stress of 100 MPa. If loads F<sub>1</sub> = 3 kN, F<sub>2</sub> = 4 kN, and F<sub>3</sub> = 2 kN, determine the maximum permissible spacing between the nails.

A force of F1 is applied a distance of L/2 from the wall, a force of F2 is applied a distance of L from the wall, and a force F3 is applied a distance of 2L from the wall. The beam has a rectangular cross section of height 12 cm and width 8 cm. A nail is in the center of the beam holding two pieces together."}
