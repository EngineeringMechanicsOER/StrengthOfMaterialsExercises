## Solution - Problem 2.4

![](images/146.png)
Three possible cables could carry the maximum load. Let us define them as $R_1$ for the cable at $45^\circ$ above the horizon at A, $R_3$ for the cable $30^\circ$ below the horizon at B, and $R_2$ for the cable $75^\circ$ above the horizon at B.

Note that we are told to ignore the cable at A holding the crate, and the horizontal cable at B can be ignored since ...

Now we need to begin solving for the cables. From method of joints, beginning with joint A in the X direction:

$$\Sigma F_x = 0$$
$$0 = -R_3*cos(30^\circ)+R_1*cos(45^\circ)$$
$$R_3*cos(30^\circ) = R_1*cos(45^\circ)$$
$$R_3 = 0.707*R_1/0.866$$
$$R_3 = 0.817*R_1$$

For forces in the Y direction at joint A:

$$\Sigma F_Y = 0$$
$$0 = -W+R_3*sin(30^\circ)+R_1*sin(45^\circ)$$
Plugging in the value for $R_3$ and moving W:

$$W = 0.817*R_1sin(30^\circ)+R_1*sin(45^\circ)$$
$$W = 0.4085*R_1+0.707*R_1$$
$$W = 1.116*R_1$$
Solving for $R_1$:

$$R_1 = 0.8961*W$$
Plugging in to solve for $R_3$:

$$R_3 = 0.817*0.8961*W$$
$$R_3 = 0.7321*W$$
Now applying the method of joints at B in the Y direction:

$$\Sigma F_y = 0$$
$$R_2*sin(75^\circ)-R_3*sin(30^\circ)=0$$
Solving for R2:

$$0.966*R_2 = 0.7321*W*0.5$$
$$R_2 = 0.3789*W$$
Now comparing forces to find the max:

$$Max F = max(|R_1|,|R_2|,|R_3|)$$
Determine the area of the cables:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A = \pi*(d/2)^2$$
And finally solve for maximum stress in a cable:

$$\sigma = F/A$$
$$solution = MaxF/(\pi*(d/2)^2)$$
