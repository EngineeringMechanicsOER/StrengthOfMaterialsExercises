# Problem 10.8 - Shear Stress {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A cantilever beam is loaded as shown, where w = 1 lb/in., F<sub>1</sub> = 5 lb, and F<sub>2</sub> = 10 lb. What is the maximum shear stress in the beam?

The applied force is applied from 12in to 42in from the left end of the beam. Force F1 is applied 54in from the wall and force F2 is applied 60in from the wall. The beam has a rectangular cross section of 6in high and 5in wide."}
