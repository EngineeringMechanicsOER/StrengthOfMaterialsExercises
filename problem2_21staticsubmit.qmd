# Problem 2.21 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A double lap joint is glued together using glue with a shear stress failure strength of 8000 psi. If dimensions L = 6 in. and t = 8 in., what is the maximum load P that the joint can withstand? Assume the load is evenly distributed across the joint on both sides.
