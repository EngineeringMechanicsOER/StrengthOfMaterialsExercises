# Problem 6.3 - Torsional Stress {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Two torques are applied to a two part circular rod as shown. If T<sub>1</sub> = -6 kip-in., T<sub>2</sub> = 2 kip-in., d<sub>1</sub> = 5 in., and d<sub>2</sub> = 4 in., what is the magnitude of the maximum shear stress?

The part attached to the wall has diameter d[1] and length 40 in. T[1] is applied at the intersection of the rods. The second rod has diameter d[2] and length 30 in. T[2] is applied at the free end."}
