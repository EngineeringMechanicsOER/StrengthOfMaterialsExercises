# Problem 7.26 - Graphical Methods for Shear Force & Bending Moment Diagrams {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume w = 30 kN/m, L<sub>1</sub> = 3.6 m, and L<sub>2</sub> = 1.2 m. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?
