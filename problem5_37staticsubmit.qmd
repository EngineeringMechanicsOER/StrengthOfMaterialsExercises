# Problem 5.37 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
Two aluminum circular rods are attached to two fixed walls as shown. Assume E = 70 MPa for both cylinders, F = 30 kN, d<sub>1</sub> = 20 mm, d<sub>2</sub>  = 30 mm, L<sub>1</sub> = 300 mm, and L<sub>2</sub> = 200 mm. Determine the normal stress in member 1.
