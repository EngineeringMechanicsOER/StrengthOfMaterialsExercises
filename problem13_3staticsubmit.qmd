# Problem 13.3 - Cylindrical {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A gas storage tank with an internal radius r<sub>i</sub> = 18 in. and wall thickness t = 3/8 in. is filled to an internal pressure P = 2,000 psi. If the original length L = 18 ft., determine the total axial deflection (change in length) of the tank after filling. Assume E = 29,000 ksi and ν = 0.3.
