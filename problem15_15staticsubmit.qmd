# Problem 15.15 - Effect of Supports {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

To draw attention, a junkyard owner mounts a car on top of a column of length L = 30 ft made from a W8 x 15 beam I<sub>x</sub> = 48.0 in.<sup>4</sup>, I<sub>y</sub> = 3.41 in.<sup>4</sup>). If the elastic modulus E = 29,000 ksi, what is the heaviest car body that can be used to avoid buckling? Use a factor of safety of 2.25.
