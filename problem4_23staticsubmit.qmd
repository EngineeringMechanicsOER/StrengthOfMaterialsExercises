# Problem 4.23 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A square steel plate of side length L = 6 in. and thickness t = 1/2 in. is uniformly pulled by two forces F<sub>x</sub> = 15 kips and F<sub>y</sub> = 25 kips as shown. If E = 29,000 ksi and Poisson's ratio v = 0.29, determine the change in thickness of the plate.
