## Problem Statement

A beam is loaded as shown. Determine the distance from point A to where the internal shear force is zero. Assume w = 3 kN/m, F<sub>1</sub> = 8 kN, and F<sub>2</sub> = 5 kN.


![Figure 1: A beam is loaded as shown.](images/332.png){fig-alt="Picture of a beam with a series of loads applied. F1 occurs at A, w occurs from A to B, and F2 occurs at C. The beam is attached to the wall at D. The distance from A to B is 3m, the distance from B to C is 2m, and the distance from C to D is 1m."}
