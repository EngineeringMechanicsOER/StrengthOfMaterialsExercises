# Problem 15.1 - Buckling & Yield - Euler's Formula {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A steel (E = 200 GPa) tube column with a yield strength of 250 MPa is pinned at both ends. If length L = 6 m, outer radius r<sub>o</sub> = 75 mm and inner radius r<sub>i</sub> = 70 mm, determine the maximum allowable load the column can support.
