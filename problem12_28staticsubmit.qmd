# Problem 12.28 - Mohr's Circle {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The state of stress at a point in a beam is shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 35 ksi, σ<sub>y</sub> = 15 ksi, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 25 ksi. Construct Mohr's Circle for the given state of stress. Then determine the maximum principal stress σ<sub>1</sub> for this state of stress, and the angle at which this stress occurs, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.
