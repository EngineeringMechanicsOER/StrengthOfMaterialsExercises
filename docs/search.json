The intent is to demonstrate a more traditional static style problem exercise pack along with dynamic versions which allow students to quickly check answers and receive basic feedback, and/or to input their math in an interactive interface which will provide them with targeted feedback based on their atempted solution.\nThis work is still very much in progress and you may find bugs. We would welcome any input or feedback you have about this. Thanks!"
