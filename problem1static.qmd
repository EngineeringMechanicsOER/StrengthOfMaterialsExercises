## Problem Statement

A city planner is installing a new traffic light. Light A weighs 65 lb, while lights B and C weigh 50 lb each. The post at O has a hollow circular cross-section with an outer diameter of 5 inches and a wall thickness of 0.2 inches. Please calculate the magnitude of the maximum combined stress in the post. You may ignore the weight of the post.

![Figure 1: Three traffic light installation with loads](images/stoplights.png){fig-alt="Picture with three distinct traffic lights oriented along the same horizontal beam. Moving from left to right of the image, the first light A is at the end of the beam, the second light B is 4 ft from A, the third light C is 4 ft from light B, and light C is 7 ft from where the horizontal beam meets the vertical post (called post O). The free body diagram includes a downforce force acting on light A with a value of 65 pounds, a downward force acting on light B with a value of 50 points, a downward force acting on light C with a value of 50 pounds, and a reaction Moment M and Force N at the post at O."}
