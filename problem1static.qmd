This is a static rendering of the problem with fixed variables that correspond to the variables used in the problem solution provided.

## Problem Statement

A city planner is installing a new traffic light. Light A weighs 65 lb, while lights B and C weigh 50 lb each. The post at O has a hollow circular cross-section with an outer diameter of 5 inches and a wall thickness of 0.2 inches. Please calculate the magnitude of the maximum combined stress in the post. You may ignore the weight of the post.

Moving from left to right of the image, the first light A is at the end of the beam, the second light B is 4 ft from A, the third light C is 4 ft from light B, and light C is 7 ft from where the horizontal beam meets the vertical post (called post O). The free body diagram includes a downforce force acting on light A with a value of 65 pounds, a downward force acting on light B with a value of 50 points, a downward force acting on light C with a value of 50 pounds, and a reaction Moment M and Force N at the post at O."}

## Worked Out Solution

This demonstrates a worked out solution to the problem. The best way to begin is by drawing a free body diagram.

The free body diagram includes a downforce force acting on light A with a value of 65 pounds, a downward force acting on light B with a value of 50 points, a downward force acting on light C with a value of 50 pounds, and a reaction Moment M and Force N at the post at O."}

Use equilibrium equations to find the internal loads:

$$
\Sigma F_y=0: N-65-50-50=0\\
$$
$$N=165~lbs
$$

$$
\Sigma M_O=0: -M+(50\times7)+(50\times11)+(65\times15)=0
\\$$
$$
M=1875~lb\cdot ft=22500~lb\cdot in
$$

Now, determine the cross-sectional properties:

$$
A=\pi(r_0^2-r_i^2)=\pi(2.5^2-2.3^2)=3.02~in^2
\\
I=
\frac{\pi}{4}
(r_0^4-r_i^4)=\frac{\pi}{4}(2.5^4-2.3^4)=8.70~in^4
$$

Calculate stress due to normal force:

$$
\sigma_n=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{-165~lbs}{3.02~in^2}=-54.7~psi
$$

Calculate maximum stress due to bending moment (will have same magnitude in both tension and compression):

$$
\sigma_m=\pm\frac{M_c}{I}=\pm\frac{22500\times2.5}{8.70}=\pm6460~psi
$$

Determine combined tensile stress: $\sigma_T=-54.7+6460=6410~psi$

Determine combined compressive stress: $\sigma_T=-54.7-6460=-6520~psi$
