# Problem 9.3 - Bending Stress {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A person of mass m = 80 kg stands on the end of a diving board with cross-section b = 300 mm and h = 50 mm. If lengths L<sub>1</sub> = 1 m and L<sub>2</sub> = 2 m, determine the maximum bending stress in the board. Assume g = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
