# Problem 14.1 - Eccentric Axial Loads {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A large column supports a cantilevered load W = 8 kips as shown. Dimensions b = 2 ft, h = 4 ft, L<sub>1</sub> = 10 ft, and L<sub>2</sub> = 10 ft. What is the magnitude of the compressive stress at point A? Assume the cantilevered beam does not fail or bend.
