# Problem 1.3 - Equilibrium in 2D {.unnumbered}

![Figure 1: A simply supported beam is subjected to a loading.](images/642.png){fig-alt="Picture with a simply supported beam being subjected to a loading. The beam is pinned at the left side and has a roller at the right end. The beam is of length 33 ft. There is a uniform distributed load over the first 21 ft of the beam of depth d and weight w. There is a triangular distributed load from 12 ft to 21 ft from the left end of the beam of height 2d and weight w. There is also a uniform distributed load from 21 ft to 33 ft from the left end of depth d and weight w."}
