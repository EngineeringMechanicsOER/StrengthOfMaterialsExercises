# Problem 7.28 - Graphical Methods for Shear Force & Bending Moment Diagrams {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume w<sub>1</sub> = 50 kN/m, and w<sub>2</sub> = 10 kN/m. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?
