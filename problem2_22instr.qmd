## Solution - Problem 2.22

![](images/165.png)
Recall the definition for shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{V}{A}$$

Solving first for area:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A = \pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2$$

As there are two rivets, the load wil be halved. Thus:

$$V = \frac{F}{2}$$

Plugging everything back in:

$$solution = \frac{\frac{F}{2}}{\pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2}$$

$$solution = \frac{F}{2*\pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2}$$
