Problem Statement:

A bracket is attached to a wall with two circular rivets of diameter d = 20 mm. A load F = 50 kN is applied in the center of the bracket. Assuming the load is split evenly between the two rivits, determine the shear stress in each rivet.

## Step 1
Recall the definition for shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{V}{A}$$

Solving first for area:

</p>

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A = \pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2$$

$$A = \pi*(\frac{20\,mm}{2})^2$$
$$A = 314.16\,mm^2$$

As there are two rivets, the load wil be halved. Thus:

$$V = \frac{F}{2}$$
$$V = \frac{50\,kN}{2}$$
$$V = 25\,kN$$

Plugging everything back in:

$$solution = \frac{25\,kN}{314.16\,mm^2}$$

$$solution = \frac{25000\,N}{3.1416*10^{-4}\,m^2}$$
$$solution = 79,557,285 Pa = 79.58 MPa$$
