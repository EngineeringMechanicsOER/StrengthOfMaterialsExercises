## Problem Statement
Three belt pulleys are connected to a solid circular shaft of diameter d = 3 in. that rotates freely at joints A and E. The pulleys are subjected to forces F<sub>1</sub> = 1 kips, F<sub>2</sub> = 1 kips, and F<sub>3</sub> = 1.5 kips. What is the maximum shear stress in the shaft between pulleys B and C?
