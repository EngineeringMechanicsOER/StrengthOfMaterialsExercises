## Problem Statement

A shaft is fixed between two walls. One portion is made from nickel (G<sub>nickel</sub> = 11.4 x 10<sup>6</sup> psi) with a diameter of d<sub>1</sub> = 2 in. The other portion is aluminum (G<sub>aluminum</sub> = 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> psi) with a diameter of d<sub>2</sub> = 4 in. A torque T = 1,000 lb-ft is applied at the point where the two materials meet. If lengths L<sub>1</sub> = 8 ft and L<sub>2</sub> = 4 ft, what is the maximum shear stress in the shaft?
