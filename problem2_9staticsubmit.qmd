# Problem 2.9 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A truss is constructed using members of area A = 2.5 in<sup>2</sup>. If loads F<sub>1</sub> = 900 lb and F<sub>2</sub> = 400 lb, determine the stress in member EG.

![Figure 1: Truss ABCDEFGHIJ is subjected to two forces.](images/150.png){fig-alt="Picture of a truss subjected to forces F1 and F2. The distance from A to B is 12 ft, the distance from B to I is 12 ft, and the distance from I to J is 12 ft. The vertical distance from F to G is 5 ft. Force F1 is applied at I and force F2 is applied at J."}
