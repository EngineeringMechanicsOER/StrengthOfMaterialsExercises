# Problem 5.11 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement 

A series of solid, steel, circular bars are loaded with forces as shown, where F<sub>1</sub> = 3 kN, F<sub>2</sub> = 2 kN, F<sub>3</sub> = 3 kN, and F<sub>4</sub> = 4 kN. What is the total change in length of the system? Assume E = 210 GPa for steel.

The third force is applied to the next bar that has a length 4 cm and diameter 0.5 cm. The fourth and final force is applied to the last bar that is attached to the wall at the other end. The fourth bar has a length 2 cm and diameter 1 cm. "}
