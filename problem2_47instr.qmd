Problem Statement:

Two slanted brackets are glued together as shown. If F = 500 lb, L = 4 in., and Θ = 20°, determine the shear stress parallel to the inclined plane. Assume loads are inline and there is no rotation.

## Step 1

Recall the definition of shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{V}{A}$$

As the force is applied at an angle:

</p>

$$V = F*sin(90^\circ-\theta)$$ Recalling conventions of geometry:

$$sin(90^\circ-\theta) = cos(\theta)$$

Thus:

$$V = F*cos(\theta)$$
$$V = 500\,lb*cos(20^\circ)$$
$$V = 469.85\,lb$$

## Step 2

To solve for the area of the plane:

$$A = L*w$$ $$A_p = 4\,in*2\,in$$
$$A_p = 8\,in^2$$

Solving for shear stress:

$$solution = \frac{469.85\,lb}{8\,in^2}$$
$$solution = 58.73\,psi$$
