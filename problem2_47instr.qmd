## Solution - Problem 2.47

![](images/153.png)
Recall the definition of shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{V}{A}$$

As the force is applied at an angle:

$$V = F*sin(90^\circ-\theta)$$
Recalling conventions of geometry:

$$sin(90^\circ-\theta) = cos(\theta)$$

Thus:

$$V = F*cos(\theta)$$

To solve for the area of the plane:

$$A = L*w$$
$$A_p = L*2\,in$$

Solving for shear stress:

$$solution = \frac{F*cos(\theta)}{2*L}$$
