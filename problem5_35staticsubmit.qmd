# Problem 5.35 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
Two blocks with square cross-sections are stacked as shown, with the top block inserted into the bottom block and subjected to load F = 3.4 kips. The top block is aluminum (E = 10,000 ksi) with side length w<sub>1</sub> = 2 in.  and the bottom block is steel (E = 29,000 ksi) with side length w<sub>2</sub> = 3 in. If length L = 5 in., what is the total deflection of the top surface? Ignore the weight of the blocks.
