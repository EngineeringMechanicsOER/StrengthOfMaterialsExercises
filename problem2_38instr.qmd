Problem Statement:

A crate of weight W = 8000 lb hangs from a solid circular metal rod of diameter d<sub>1</sub> = 1 in. The cable is wrapped around a support collar of diameter d<sub>2</sub> = 3 in. and thickness t = 2 in. to evenly distribute the cable load. What is the bearing stress on the support collar due to the rod?

## Step 1
Recall the formula for bending stress:

$$\sigma_B = \frac{F}{A}$$

Solving for area:

$$A = d*t$$

For the rod of interest:

$$A = d_1*t$$
$$A = 1\,in*2\,in$$
$$A = 2\,in^2$$

Plugging back in:

$$solution = \frac{8000\,lb}{2\,in^2}$$
$$solution = 4000\,lb=4.0\,ksi$$
