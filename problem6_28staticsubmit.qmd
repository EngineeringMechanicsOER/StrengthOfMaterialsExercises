## Problem Statement

A composite circular rod is made from two different plastics. A torque of T = 4 kN-m is applied at the midpoint. The right end is free. What is the maximum stress in either material? Assume length L = 10 cm and the shear modulus of the two materials are G<sub>1</sub> = 2 GPa and G<sub>2</sub> = 1 GPa.
