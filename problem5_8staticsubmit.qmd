# Problem 5.8 - Stress Concentrations {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A flat bar of thickness t = 0.25 in. narrows with fillets as shown. If a load P = 3200 lb is applied, determine the maximum stress in the bar.

![Figure 1: A bar narrows in width.](images/666.png){fig-alt="A flat bar of thickness t with fillets has a load of P applied. The bar has a maximum width of 2.25 in and narrows to 1.5 in. The filets have a radius of 0.25 in."}
