## Problem Statement

A steel rod of diameter d = 4 mm is attached to walls A and C as shown. Two forces F = 2 kN are applied at distance L = 100 mm. If the shear modulus of the rod G = 75 GPa, determine the maximum shear stress in the rod.

The load is applied to a perpendicular rod at a distance L from the steel rod. The steel rod has diameter d, the distance between the AB is 40 cm, and the distance between BC is 30 cm."}
