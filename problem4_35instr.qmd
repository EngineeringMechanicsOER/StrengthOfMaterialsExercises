First, all the member loads need to be determined. From inspection:

$$F_{BD} = F$$

Next, by applying method of joints at D in the X direciton:

$$\Sigma F_x = 0$$
$$0 = -F_{AD}*cos(tan^{-1}(1m/2m))+F_{DC}*cos(tan^{-1}(1m/1m))$$

Solving for $F_{DC}$:

$$F_{DC}*cos(45^\circ) = F_{AD}*cos(26.75^\circ)$$
$$F_{DC} = 1.263*F_{AD}$$

Now applying method of joints at D in the Y direction:

$$\Sigma F_y = 0$$
$$ 0 = -F+F_{AD}*sin(26.75^\circ)+F_{DC}*sin(45^\circ)$$

Substituting $F_{DC}$ and moving F:

$$F = 0.45*F_{AD}+1.263*F_{AD}*0.707$$

Solving for $F_{AD}$:

$$F = 1.343*F_{AD}$$
$$F_{AD} = 0.745*F$$

Now solving for $F_{DC}$:

$$F_{DC} = 1.263*0.745*F$$
$$F_{DC} = 0.941*F$$

Now applying the method of joints at C in the X direction:

$$\Sigma F_x = 0$$
$$0 = -F_{BC}-F_{DC}*cos(45^\circ)$$

Solving for $F_{BC}$:

$$F_{BC} = -0.941*F*0.707$$
$$F_{BC} = -0.665*F$$
The largest load occurs in $F_{BC}$, thus we will design for it. Assuming a Factor of Safety of F.S.:

$$Design Load = F.S.*F_{BD}$$
Recall the formula for normal stress:

$$\sigma = F/A$$

Solving for A:

$$A = F/\sigma$$

Plugging in our variables:

$$A = Design Load/\sigma_{fail}$$
$$A = F.S.*F_{BD}/\sigma_{fail}$$
Recall the area formula:

$$A = a*a$$
Thus solving for a:

$$a^2 = F.S.*F_{BD}/\sigma_{fail}$$
$$solution = \sqrt(F.S.*F_{BD}/\sigma_{fail})$$
