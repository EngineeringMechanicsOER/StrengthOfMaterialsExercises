Problem Statement:

A small truss is constructed with solid square wood members and subjected to a load of F = 30 kN. Determine the minimum dimension, a, of the member so that the truss will have a factor of safety of 2. All members have the same cross-section. The wood has a failure stress of σfail = 50 MPa.

## Step 1
First, all the member loads need to be determined. From inspection:

$$F_{BD} = F = 30\,kN$$

Next, by applying method of joints at D in the X direction:

$$\Sigma F_x = 0$$
$$0 = -F_{AD}*cos(tan^{-1}(\frac{1\,m}{2\,m}))+F_{DC}*cos(tan^{-1}(\frac{1\,m}{1\,m}))$$

Solving for $F_{DC}$

$$F_{DC}*cos(45^\circ) = F_{AD}*cos(26.75^\circ)$$
$$F_{DC} = 1.263*F_{AD}$$

Now applying method of joints at D in the Y direction:

$$\Sigma F_y = 0$$
$$ 0 = -F+F_{AD}*sin(26.75^\circ)+F_{DC}*sin(45^\circ)$$

Substituting $F_{DC}$ and moving F:

$$F = 0.45*F_{AD}+1.263*F_{AD}*0.707$$

Solving for $F_{AD}$

$$F = 1.343*F_{AD}$$
$$F_{AD} = 0.745*F$$
$$F_{AD} = 0.745*30\,kN$$
$$F_{AD} = 22.35\,kN$$
Now solving for $F_{DC}$

$$F_{DC} = 1.263*22.35\,kN$$
$$F_{DC} = 27.62\,kN$$

## Step 2
Now applying the method of joints at C in the X direction:

$$\Sigma F_x = 0$$
$$0 = -F_{BC}-F_{DC}*cos(45^\circ)$$

Solving for $F_{BC}$ 
$$F_{BC} = -27.62\,kN*cos(45^\circ)$$
$$F_{BC} = -19.53\,kN$$

## Step 3
The largest load occurs in $F_{BC}$, thus we will design for it. Assuming a Factor of Safety of F.S.:

$$Design\,Load = F.S.*F_{BD}$$
$$Design\,Load = 2*30\,kN$$
$$Design\,Load = 60\,kN$$
Recall the formula for normal stress:

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

Solving for A:

$$A = \frac{F}{\sigma}$$

Plugging in our variables:

$$A = \frac{Design Load}{\sigma_{fail}}$$
$$A = \frac{60\,kN}{50\,MPa}=\frac{60\,kN}{50000\,kPa}$$
$$A = 0.0012\,m^2$$
Recall the area formula:

$$A = a*a$$
Thus solving for a:

$$a^2 = 0.0012\,m^2$$
$$solution = \sqrt{0.0012\,m^2}$$
$$solution = 0.0346\,m = 3.46\,cm$$
