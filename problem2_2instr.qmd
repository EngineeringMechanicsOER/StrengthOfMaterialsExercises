Problem Statement:

Two cylinders are stacked on top of one another and two forces are applied at the top surface and at the joint between the cylinders as shown. If L<sub>1</sub> = 3 in., L<sub>2</sub> = 4 in., F<sub>A</sub> = 500 lb, and F<sub>B</sub> = 200 lb, find the total deflection in the stack of cylinders. Assume E = 30 x 10<sup>6</sup> psi for both cylinders.

Total deflection for the system needs to be found:

$$\delta = \frac{FL}{AE}$$ $$\delta_T = \delta_A+\delta_B$$

Areas for A and B need to be calculated:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$ $$A_A = \pi*(\frac{5\,in}{2})^2 = 19.63\,in^2$$ $$A_B = \pi*(\frac{3\,in}{2})^2 = 7.07\,in^2$$ We are told the value for E:

$$E = 30*10^6\,psi$$

Deflection for A and B can now be found. First solving for the deflection from A:

$$\delta_A = \frac{F_A*L_1}{A_A*E}$$ $$\delta_A = \frac{500\,lb*3\,in}{19.63\,in^2*30*10^6\,psi}$$ $$\delta_A = 2.55*10^{-6}\,in$$ Now the deflection from B:

$$solution = \delta_A+\delta_B$$ $$solution = 2.55*10^{-6}\,in+3.77*10^{-6}\,in=6.32*10^{-6}\,in$$
