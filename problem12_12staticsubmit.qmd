# Problem 12.12 - Principal Stresses {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The state of stress at a point in a beam is shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 3 MPa, σ<sub>y</sub> = 5 MPa, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 3 MPa. Determine the maximum principal stress σ<sub>1</sub> for this state of stress, and the angle at which this stress occurs, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.
