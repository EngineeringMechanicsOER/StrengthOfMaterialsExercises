# Problem 9.32 - Unsymmetric Bending {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Two moments, M<sub>z</sub> = 1.5 kN-m and M<sub>y</sub> = 1.0 kN-m, act on a beam with the rectangular cross-section shown. If base b = 80 mm and height h = 60 mm, determine the bending stress at point A. Recall the convention that tensile stresses are positive and compressive stresses are negative.
