## Solution - Problem 2.3

![](images/144.png)
First normal stress needs to be defined:

$$\sigma = F/A$$

Since $A$ is in the denominator, the maximum normal stress will occur at the smallest area ($d_1$).

$A_1$ can now be found:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A_1 = \pi*(d_1/2)^2$$

The maximum normal stress can now be found:

$$solution = F/A_1$$
$$solution = F/(\pi*(d_1/2)^2)$$
