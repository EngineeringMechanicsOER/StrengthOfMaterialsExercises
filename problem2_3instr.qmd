## Solution - Problem 2.3

![](images/144.png)
Problem Statement:

A plastic cylindrical peg is constrained by a metal cap as shown. An axial load of F = 40 lb is applied to the peg. If d<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 in and d<sub>2</sub> = 0.9 in, determine the normal stress in the peg. Assume the axial load is evenly distributed across the peg and that the metal cap is fixed and does not move.

First normal stress needs to be defined:

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

Since $A$ is in the denominator, the maximum normal stress will occur at the smallest area ($d_1$).

$A_1$ can now be found:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A_1 = \pi*(\frac{0.5\,in}{2})^2=0.196\,in^2$$

The maximum normal stress can now be found:

$$solution = \frac{40\,lb}{0.196\,in^2}=204.08\,psi$$
