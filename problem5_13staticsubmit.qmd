# Problem 5.13 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
Two forces, F<sub>1</sub> = 1 kN and F<sub>2</sub> = 2 kN, are applied to the system of cylinders as shown. If L<sub>1</sub> = 10 mm and L<sub>2</sub> = 14 mm, what is the total change in length of the system. Assume E<sub>brass</sub> = 100 GPa and E<sub>aluminum</sub> = 70 GPa.

The cylinder on the left is made of brass and attached to the wall, with a load applied at the intersection of the cylinders. The brass cylinder has a length L[1] a radius of 2 mm. The second cylinder is made of aluminum, has a length of L[2], and has a radius of 3 mm. The scn load is applied to the end of the aluminum cylinder."}
