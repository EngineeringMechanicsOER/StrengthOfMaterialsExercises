# Problem 10.20 - Shear Flow {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A T-beam is constructed from two wooden boards nailed together as shown. The nails can withstand a shear load of 10 kN and the beam is subjected to a maximum shear force V = 30 kN. If dimensions b<sub>1</sub> =20 mm, b<sub>2</sub> = 200 mm, h<sub>1</sub> = 160 mm, and h<sub>2</sub> = 20 mm, determine the minimum permissible spacing between the nails.
