## Solution - Problem 2.48

![](images/156.png)
Recall the definition of normal stress:

$$\sigma_n = F/A$$

Solving for area:

$$A = t*h$$
$$A = 2in*h$$

The cut occurs at $\theta^\circ$ off the vertical, as such:

$$\sigma_n = (F/A)*cos^2(\theta)$$

Solving for the normal stress:

$$solution = (F/(2*h))*cos^2(\theta)$$
