## Solution - Problem 2.48

![](images/156.png)
Recall the definition of normal stress:

$$\sigma_n = \frac{F}{A}$$

Solving for area:

$$A = t*h$$
$$A = 2\,in*h$$

The cut occurs at $\theta^\circ$ off the vertical, as such:

$$\sigma_n = \frac{F}{A}*cos^2(\theta)$$

Solving for the normal stress:

$$solution = \frac{F*cos^2(\theta)}{2*h}$$
