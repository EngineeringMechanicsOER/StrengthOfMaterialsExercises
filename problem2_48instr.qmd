Problem Statement:

A 2 inch thick board is cut and then glued back together along a line that is Θ = 15° off the vertical as shown. If height h = 10 in. and F = 3500 lb, determine the normal stress along the cut line.

## Step 1

Recall the definition of normal stress:

$$\sigma_n = \frac{F}{A}$$

Solving for area:

$$A = t*h$$ $$A = 2\,in*10\,in$$
$$A = 20\,in^2$$

## Step 2

The cut occurs at $\theta^\circ$ off the vertical, as such:

$$\sigma_n = \frac{F}{A}*cos^2(\theta)$$

Solving for the normal stress:

$$solution = \frac{3500\,lb*cos^2(15^\circ)}{20\,in^2}$$
$$solution = 163.28\,psi$$
