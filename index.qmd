# Welcome to Demo Site {.unnumbered}

Welcome to this demonstration site of the Strength of Materials Open Problem Exercises companion to the Strength of Materials Open Textbook.

At this time, we are simply using this site as a demonstration and shell for our ongoing work.  The intent is to demonstrate a more traditional static style problem exercise pack along with dynamic versions which allow students to quickly check answers and receive basic feedback, and/or to input their math in an interactive interface which will provide them with targeted feedback based on their atempted solution.

This work is still very much in progress and you may find bugs. We would welcome any input or feedback you have about this. Thanks!
