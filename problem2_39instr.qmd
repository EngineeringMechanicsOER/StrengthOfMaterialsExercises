Problem Statement:

A link mechanism is connected with pins of diameter d = 0.5 in. A force F = 500 lb is applied to the mechanism as shown. The mechanism has width w = 1 in. and thickness t = 0.25 in. What is the bearing stress in member BC at joint B due to the pin at B?

## Step 1
Recall the formula for bearing stress:

$$\sigma_b = \frac{F}{A_B}$$
Solving first for the reaction at B with the sum of moments:

$$\Sigma M_A = 0$$

$$18\,in*R_B-(18\,in+8\,in)*500\,lb = 0$$

$$18\,in*R_B = 13000\,in\,lb$$

$$R_B = 722.22\,lb$$

## Step 2
Solving next for area:

$$A_B = d*t$$

$$A_B = 0.5\,in*0.25\,in$$

$$A_B = 0.125\,in^2$$

Plugging everything back in:

$$Solution = \frac{722.22\,lb}{0.125\,in^2}$$
$$Solution = 5777.76\,psi = 5.78\,ksi$$
