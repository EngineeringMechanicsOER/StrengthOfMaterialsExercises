## Solution - Problem 2.39

![](images/180.png) Recall the formula for bearing stress:

$$\sigma_b = \frac{F}{A_b}$$

Solving first for the reaction at B with the sum of moments:

$$\Sigma M_A = 0$$

$$18in*R-(18in+8in)*F = 0$$

$$18in*R = 26in*F$$

$$R = 1.444*F$$

Solving next for area:

$$A_b = d*t$$

Plugging everything back in:

$$Solution = \frac{1.444*F}{d*t}$$
