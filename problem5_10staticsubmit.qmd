# Problem 5.10 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The linkage of thickness t = 0.5 in. shown is subjected to load P = 25 kips. Determine the maximum stress in the linkage.

![Figure 1: A linkage is subjected to a loading as shown.](images/668.png){fig-alt="Picture with a linkage being subjected to a loading P. The linkage has a thickness of t, an initial width of 2in, a final width of 4in, and filets of radius 0.5 in. The linkage has a hole of diameter 1.5 in drilled in the wide part."}
