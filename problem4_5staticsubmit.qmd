# Problem 4.5 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A single force F = 3 kips pulls on three cylindrical rods, each of length L = 6 in., Diameter d<sub>1</sub> = 2 in., and d<sub>2</sub> = 1 in. What is the strain in the steel cylinder? Assume E<sub>steel</sub> = 29,000 ksi and E<sub>aluminum</sub> = 10,000 ksi.
