# Problem 5.51 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The W = 1,000 kg weight is placed on a L = 1 m tall brass bar with a cross section of d = 2.5 cm. If the bar undergoes a temperature change of 50°C, what is the total deformation of the bar? Assume the Young's Modulus and thermal coefficient of expansion is 100 GPa and 10 x 10<sup>-6</sup> /°C, respectively. Also, assume no buckling.
