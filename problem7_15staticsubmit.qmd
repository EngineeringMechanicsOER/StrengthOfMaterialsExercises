# Problem 7.15 - Shear Force & Bending Moment Equations {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume M = 10 kip-ft, L<sub>1</sub> = 3 ft, and L<sub>2</sub> = 4 ft. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?
