# Problem 13.4 - Cylindrical {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel with an inner diameter d<sub>i</sub> = 240 mm is subjected to an unknown internal pressure, P. A vertical load F = 1 kN is also applied to the vessel as shown. If length L = 3.2 m and the wall thickness t = 1 mm, what pressure will cause the axial and hoop stresses to be equal?
