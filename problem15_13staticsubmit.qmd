# Problem 15.13 - Effect of Supports {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A W8 x 15 beam (I<sub>x</sub> = 48.0 in.<sup>4</sup>, I<sub>y</sub> = 3.41 in.<sup>4</sup>) is used as a column with one end fixed and the other end pinned. If the length of the column L = 25 ft, determine the largest load it can carry with a factor of safety of 2. The elastic modulus E = 10,000 ksi.
