# Problem 9.25 - Beam Design {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A wide flange I-beam is subjected to both a distributed load w = 4 kN/m and a point load F = 25 kN. If length L<sub>1</sub> = 10 m, L<sub>2</sub> = 5 m, and the failure stress is 375 MPa, what is the lightest W-beam from Appendix A that could be used for the beam?
