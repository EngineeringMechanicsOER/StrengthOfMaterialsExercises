# Problem 13.16 - Spherical {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A spherical thin-walled pressure vessel is to be constructed of steel with a yield stress of 50 ksi and a wall thickness t = 1/4 in. If the internal diameter of the tank is d<sub>i</sub> = 20 ft, determine the maximum allowable pressure before yielding.
