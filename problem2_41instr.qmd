## Solution - Problem 2.41

Recall the formula for bearing stress:

$$\sigma_b = P_b/A_b$$

Two objects will have bearing stress, the steel connector and the brass rod. Starting with the steel connector, the area is:

$$A_{c-b} = t*d$$

Solving for the bearing load:

$$P_{c-b} = \sigma_{r-b}*A_{c-b}$$

Plugging what we know in:

$$P_{c-b} = 75ksi*t*d$$

Now for the brass rod. First to find the area:

$$A_{r-b} = d*t$$

Now solving for the bearing load:

$$P_{r-b} = \sigma_{r-b}*A_{r-b}$$

Plugging what we know in:

$$P_{r-b} = 70ksi*d*t$$

The brass rod will fail before the steel connector, thus:

$$solution = 70ksi*d*t$$
