# Problem 12.26 - Mohr's Circle {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The state of stress at a point in a beam is shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 20 MPa, σ<sub>y</sub> = 10 MPa, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 10 MPa. Construct Mohr's Circle for the given state of stress. Then determine the maximum principal stress σ<sub>1</sub> for this state of stress, and the angle at which this stress occurs, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.
