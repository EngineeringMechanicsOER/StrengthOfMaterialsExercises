Problem Statement:

A double lap joint is glued together using glue with a shear stress failure strength of 8000 psi. If dimensions L = 6 in. and t = 8 in., what is the maximum load P that the joint can withstand? Assume the load is evenly distributed across the joint on both sides.

## Step 1
Recall the formula for shear stress:

$$\tau_{fail} = \frac{P}{A}$$

Solving first for area:

$$A = L*t$$
$$A = 6\,in*8\,in$$
$$A = 48\,in^2$$
Remember there are two joints, thus area will be multiplied by $2$.

Plugging A back in:

$$\tau_{fail} = \frac{P}{2*48\,in^2}$$
$$\tau_{fail} = \frac{P}{96\,in^2}$$

And solving for P:

$$solution = \tau_{fail}*96\,in^2$$
$$solution = 8000\,psi*96\,in^2$$
$$solution = 768,000\,lb = 768.0\,kip$$
