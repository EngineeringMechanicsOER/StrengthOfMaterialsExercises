## Solution - Problem 2.21

![](images/164.png)
Recall the formula for shear stress:

$$\tau_{fail} = \frac{P}{A}$$

Solving first for area:

$$A = L*t$$

Remember there are two joints, thus area will be multiplied by $2$.

Plugging A back in:

$$\tau_{fail} = \frac{P}{2*L*t}$$

And solving for P:

$$solution = \tau_{fail}*2*L*t$$
