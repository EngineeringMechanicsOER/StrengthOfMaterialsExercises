# Problem 9.24 - Beam Design {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A wide flange I-beam is fixed at one end into a wall, and loaded with both a distributed load w = 0.5 kN/m and a point load F = 1 kN. If length L = 12 m and the failure stress is 250 MPa, what is the lightest W-beam from Appendix A that could be used for the beam? Use a factor of safety of 2.
