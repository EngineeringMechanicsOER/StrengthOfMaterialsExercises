# Problem 11.5 - By Integration of Moment Equation {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A cantilever beam of length L = 6.5 ft is subjected to a distributed load w = 300 lb/in. and a concentrated load F = 2.5 kips as shown. Determine the magnitude of the deflection of the beam at point B. Assume EI = 45,000 kip-in.<sup>2</sup>.
