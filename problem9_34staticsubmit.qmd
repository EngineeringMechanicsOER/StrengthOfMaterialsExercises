# Problem 9.34 - Unsymmetric Bending {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A cantilevered beam is subjected to a load F = 10 kN at its end, oriented Θ = 25° from the vertical. If length L = 0.35 m, determine the maximum bending stress in the beam. The beam has outer radius r<sub>o</sub> = 40 mm and inner radius r<sub>i</sub> = 30 mm.
