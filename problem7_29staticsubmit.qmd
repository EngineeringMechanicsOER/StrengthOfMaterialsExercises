# Problem 7.29 - Graphical Methods for Shear Force & Bending Moment Diagrams {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume w<sub>1</sub> = 2 kip/ft and w<sub>2</sub> = 4 kip/ft. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?
