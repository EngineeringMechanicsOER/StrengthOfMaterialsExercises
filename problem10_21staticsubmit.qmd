# Problem 10.21 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A beam is constructed from two boards nailed together as shown, with dimensions b = 3 in., h<sub>1</sub> = 1 in., and h<sub>2</sub> = 2 in.  The nails can withstand a shear load of 850 lb and the beam is subjected to a maximum shear force V = 2 kips. Determine the minimum permissible spacing between the nails.
