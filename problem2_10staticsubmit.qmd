# Problem 2.10 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A truss is constructed of members with rectangular cross-sections of base b = 3 in. and height h = 6 in. If loads F<sub>1</sub> = 2 kips and F<sub>2</sub> = 3 kips, determine the normal stress in member EF. Recall that, by convention, compressive stresses are negative.

The distance from A to B is 3 ft, the distance from B to C is 3 ft, and the distance from C to D is 3 ft. The vertical distance from C to F is 3 ft. Force F1 is applied at B and force F2 is applied at C."}
