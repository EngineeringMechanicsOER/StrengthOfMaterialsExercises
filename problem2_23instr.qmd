Problem Statement:

A square bar of length L<sub>1</sub> = 10 in. and L<sub>2</sub> = 14 in. is pinned at one end and rests on a circular rod of diameter d = 0.625 in. A force F = 60 lb is applied at the free end. What is the average shear stress in the circular rod?

## Step 1
Recall the formula for shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{F}{A}$$

First, the reaction force at the bar needs to be determined. By applying the sum of moments at the wall:

$$\Sigma M_w = 0$$
$$0 = R*L_1-F*(L_1+L_2)$$

Solving for R:

$$F*(L_1+L_2) = R*L_1$$
$$R = \frac{F*(L_1+L_2)}{L_1}$$
$$R = \frac{60\,lb*(10\,in+14\,in)}{10\,in}$$
$$R = 144\,lb$$

## Step 2
Area can be calculated next:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A = \pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2$$
$$A = \pi*(\frac{0.625\,in}{2})^2$$
$$A = 0.3068\,in^2$$
Since the bar rests on top of the rod, two surfaces will carry the shear load. As such, the area will be multiplied by $2$.

Plugging everything back in:

$$\tau = \frac{R}{2*A}$$
$$solution = \frac{144\,lb}{2*0.3068\,in^2}$$
$$solution = 234.7\,psi$$
