## Solution - Problem 2.23

![](images/168.png)
Recall the formula for shear stress:

$$\tau = \frac{F}{A}$$

First, the reaction force at the bar needs to be determined. By applying the sum of moments at the wall:

$$\Sigma M_w = 0$$
$$0 = R*L_1-F*(L_1+L_2)$$

Solving for R:

$$F*(L_1+L_2) = R*L_1$$
$$R = \frac{F*(L_1+L_2)}{L_1}$$

Area can be calculated next:

$$A = \pi*r^2$$
$$A = \pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2$$
Since the bar rests on top of the rod, two surfaces will carry the shear load. As such, the area will be multiplied by $2$.

Plugging everything back in:

$$\tau = \frac{R}{2*A}$$
$$solution = \frac{\frac{F*(L_1+L_2)}{L_1}}{2*\pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2}$$
$$solution = \frac{F*(L_1+L_2)}{L_1*2*\pi*(\frac{d}{2})^2}$$
