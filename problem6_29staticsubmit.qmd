## Problem Statement

A composite circular rod is made from aluminum (G = 3,800 ksi) and steel (G = 11,000 ksi) as shown. A torque T = 800 lb-ft is applied to the free end. What is the maximum stress in either material? Assume length L = 12 in., outer radius r<sub>o</sub> = 1.5 in., and inner radius r<sub>i</sub> = 1 in.
