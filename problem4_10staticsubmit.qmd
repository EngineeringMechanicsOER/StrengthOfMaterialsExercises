# Problem 4.10 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A circular rod of an unknown metallic alloy is placed in tension with a P = 5 kip axial load. The length of the rod is L = 10 in. and the diameter is d = 1 in. After applying the load, the rod length increases by 0.0035 in and the diameter decreases by 0.00014 in. What is the Poisson's ratio of the alloy?
