## Problem Statement

A material made from fibers is stressed as shown in the diagram. Stresses σ<sub>x</sub> = 45 ksi, σ<sub>y</sub> = 5 ksi, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 10 ksi. Determine the magnitude of the normal stress acting perpendicular to the fibers and the magnitude of the shear stress acting parallel to the fibers if angle Θ = 18°.
