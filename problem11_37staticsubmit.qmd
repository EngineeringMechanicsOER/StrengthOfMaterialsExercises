# Problem 11.37 - Statically Indeterminate Problems {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A beam is subjected to two distributed loads, w<sub>1</sub> = 2 kN/m and w<sub>2</sub> = 3 kN/m as shown. It is supported by a pin at A and rollers at B and C. If length L = 2 m, determine the reaction force at support B. Assume EI = 30,000 kN-m<sup>2</sup>.
