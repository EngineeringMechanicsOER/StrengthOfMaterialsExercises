# Problem 9.31 - Unsymmetric Bending {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

Two loads, F<sub>1</sub> = 8 kips and F<sub>2</sub> = 12 kips, are applied at the end of a cantilever beam as shown. Both loads act through the center of the rectangular cross-section of base b = 6 in. and height h = 12 in. If length L = 5 ft, determine the stress at point P in the beam at the wall.
