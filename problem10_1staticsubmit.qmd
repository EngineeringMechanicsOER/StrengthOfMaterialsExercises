# Problem 10.1 - 1st Moment of Area {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

For the built-up T-beam shown, determine the first moment of area, Q, at point A and at the centroid of the cross-section. Assume dimensions b<sub>1</sub> = 1.5 in., b<sub>2</sub> = 5.5 in., h<sub>1</sub> = 7.5 in., and h<sub>2</sub> = 1.5 in.
