# Problem 5.55 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
Bars AB and BC are pinned at joint B. Both bars are made from the same material with E = 200 GPa, v = 0.32, and a = 11.7 x 10<sup>-6</sup> /°C. Dimensions L = 400  mm, t = 33 mm, h = 15 mm, and d = 10 mm. If both bars are heated by 20 °C, determine the shear stress generated in the pin at B.
