# Problem 12.3 - Equations {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A point in a beam is subjected to the state of stress shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 5.0 MPa, σ<sub>y</sub> = 12.5 MPa, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 3.5 MPa. Determine the magnitude of the normal stress and the magnitude of the shear stress acting on plane a-a if angle Θ = 67°.
