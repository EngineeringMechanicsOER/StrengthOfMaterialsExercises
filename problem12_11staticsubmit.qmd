# Problem 12.11 - Principal Stresses {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

The state of stress at a point in a beam is shown, where σ<sub>x</sub> = 35.8 ksi, σ<sub>y</sub> = 11.5 ksi, and τ<sub>xy</sub> = 56.3 ksi. Determine the maximum shear stress for this state of stress, and the angle at which this stress occurs, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.
